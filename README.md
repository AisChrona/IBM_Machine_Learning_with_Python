# IBM â€“ Machine Learning with Python

A detailed course offered by IBM, focused on understanding and applying core machine learning techniques using Python.

  ## What I Learned

-  The difference between **Statistical Modeling** and **Machine Learning**
-  Real-life applications in **healthcare, telecom, finance**, and more
-  Python libraries for ML â€“ especially **scikit-learn**
-  Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning (with full hands-on practice)

## Covered Modules (with Objectives)

### Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
- ML applications in real-world industries
- Differences between statistical modeling and ML
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Tools and libraries like scikit-learn

### Module 2: Regression
- Simple Linear, Multiple Linear, Non-Linear Regression
- Metrics: MAE, MSE
- Evaluation methods: Train/Test split vs same-data testing
- Full Python lab implementations

### Module 3: Classification
- Algorithms: KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM
- Evaluation Metrics: Jaccard Index, F1-Score, Log Loss
- Applied in scikit-learn with real dataset

### Module 4: Clustering
